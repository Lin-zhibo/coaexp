Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/PLCPU_Top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

1. Incremental synthesis run: no

   Reason for not running incremental synthesis : 


INFO: [Synth 8-7130] Flow is switching to default flow due to incremental criteria not met. If you would like to alter this behaviour and have the flow terminate instead, please set the following parameter config_implementation {autoIncr.Synth.RejectBehavior Terminate}
